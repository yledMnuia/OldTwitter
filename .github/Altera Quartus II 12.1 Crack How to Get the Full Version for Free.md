1. Create a new project by selecting File > New Project Wizard. You will need to specify the project name, location, device family, device model, and other settings.
2. Add source files to your project by selecting Project > Add/Remove Files in Project. You can add existing files or create new ones using the built-in editors for schematic, VHDL, Verilog, or other languages.
3. Compile your design by selecting Processing > Start Compilation. The software will check for errors, synthesize your design, perform timing analysis, generate programming files, and report the results.
4. Simulate your design by selecting Tools > Simulation Tool. You can choose between ModelSim-Altera Starter Edition (free) or ModelSim-Altera Edition (licensed) as the simulation tool. You will need to create a testbench file that contains stimulus signals for your design.
5. Program your device by selecting Tools > Programmer. You will need to connect your device to your computer using a USB-Blaster cable or other supported hardware. You can then select the programming file (.sof) and click Start to program your device.

## Conclusion
 
Altera Quartus II 12.1 Web Edition Software is a powerful and user-friendly tool for FPGA design, simulation, and programming. It supports a wide range of device families and operating systems. You can download it for free from the Intel website or request a DVD. You can use it to create projects, edit source files, compile designs, run simulations, generate programming files, and program devices.
