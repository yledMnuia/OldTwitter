In this article, we will show you some of the features and benefits of Tonne Software Meter, and how you can use it to create your own meter scales.
 
## What is Tonne Software Meter?
 
Tonne Software Meter is a Windows-based program that lets you design and print custom meter scales for analog and digital meters. It was created by Jim Tonne, a radio amateur and engineer who has been developing software for electronics hobbyists since 1985. You can download the latest version of Tonne Software Meter from his website[^3^] for free.
 
Tonne Software Meter has a user-friendly interface that allows you to draw and edit meter scales with ease. You can choose from different scale types, such as linear, logarithmic, exponential, square root, or custom. You can also adjust the scale range, units, decimals, and resolution. You can add labels, tick marks, pointers, zones, and other elements to your scale. You can change the colors, fonts, sizes, and styles of your scale components. You can preview your scale on the screen or print it out on paper.
 
## Why Use Tonne Software Meter?
 
Tonne Software Meter has many advantages over other methods of creating custom meter scales. Here are some of them:
 
- It is free and easy to use. You don't need any special skills or equipment to use Tonne Software Meter. You just need a computer, a printer, and some paper.
- It is flexible and versatile. You can design any kind of meter scale you want with Tonne Software Meter. You can create scales for different meter movements, such as DC or AC voltmeters, ammeters, ohmmeters, wattmeters, frequency meters, etc. You can also create scales for digital meters, bargraphs, and LEDs.
- It is accurate and precise. Tonne Software Meter allows you to calibrate your meter scales with high accuracy and precision. You can enter the exact values of your meter movement parameters, such as full-scale deflection (FSD), zero offset (ZO), internal resistance (Ri), etc. You can also enter the values of any external shunts or multipliers that you use with your meter. Tonne Software Meter will calculate the correct scale values for your meter based on these parameters.
- It is fun and creative. Tonne Software Meter gives you the freedom to design your own meter scales according to your preferences and needs. You can customize your scales with different colors, fonts, styles, and effects. You can also add your own logos, images, or text to your scales.

1. Download and install Tonne Software Meter from Jim Tonne's website[^3^]. The installation process is simple and straightforward.
2. Run Tonne Software Meter from your desktop or start menu. You will see the main window of the program with a blank scale.
3. Select the type of meter movement that you want to design a scale for from the drop-down menu at the top left corner of the window. For example, if you want to design a scale for a DC voltmeter with a 50 uA FSD movement, select "DC Voltmeter" from the menu.
4. Enter the parameters of your meter movement in the boxes below the menu. For example, if your meter movement has a 50 uA FSD, a 0 uA ZO, and a 10 kOhm Ri, enter these values in the corresponding boxes.
5. Enter the values of any external shunts or multipliers that you use with your meter in the boxes 8cf37b1e13
